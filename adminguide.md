# Docker Trusted Registry Administrator tasks

This document explains the tasks and functions an administrator of Docker
Trusted Registry needs to understand such as reporting, logging, system
management, performance metrics, optimizing the Trusted Registry file size, and
deleting containers. For tasks Docker Trusted Registry users need to accomplish,
such as pushing and pulling images, go to the [User's Guide](userguide.md). For
using the Trusted Registry user interface (UI) to view, manage, or assign
permissions regarding repositories, organizations, and teams, go to the
[Account management](accounts.md) documentation.

## Reporting Dashboard

![Docker Trusted Registry Dashboard</admin/metrics/>](assets/admin-metrics.png)

The Docker Trusted Registry Dashboard displays "hardware" resource utilization
and network traffic metrics for the Docker Trusted Registry host as well as for
each of its contained services. The CPU and RAM usage meters at the top indicate
overall resource usage for the host, while detailed time-series charts are
provided below for each container providing a Docker Trusted Registry service.

In addition, if your registry is using a filesystem storage driver, you can view
a usage meter indicating used and available space on the storage volume.
Third-party storage back-ends are not supported. If you are using one, this
meter is not displayed.

You can mouse-over the charts or meters to see detailed data points.

Clicking a service name, such as Load Balancer or Admin Server, displays the
network, CPU, and memory (RAM) utilization data for the specified service. See
the following for a [detailed explanation of the available services](#services).

### Settings tab

Use the settings tab to configure your Trusted Registry. It is further
sub-catagorized into the following sub-headings:

* **General**, including Notary settings
* **Security**, SSL certificates and SSL private key
* **Storage**, where you can set an optional storage back-end
* **License**, where you apply your license
* **Garbage collection**, set up cron job
* **Auth**, authentication method settings: managed or LDAP

* **Updates**, where you upgrade your registry

Refer to the [configuration documentation](configuration.md) for details.

### Repositories tab

Use this tab to create or view repositories that are either public or private.
For details on how account management works, see the [account management documentation](accounts.md). Note that at this time, more functionality is accessed through the APIs. View the API documentation for details.

### Organization tab

Use this tab to create or view organizations. For details on how account
management works, see the [account management documentation](accounts.md). Note that at this time, more functionality is accessed through the APIs. View
the API documentation for details.

### Logs tab

![System Logs page</admin/logs/>](assets/admin-logs.png)

Use this tab to view the logs from your Docker Trusted Registry's containers.
Based on the  filter, see log sections for each service. Older or newer logs can
be loaded by scrolling up or down. See the following for a detailed
[explanation of the available services](#services).

The Trusted Registry's log files are located on the host in
`/usr/local/etc/dtr/logs/`. They are limited to a maximum size of 64mb. They are
rotated every two weeks, when the aggregator sends logs to the collection
server, or they are rotated if a logfile would exceed 64mb without rotation. Log
files are named `<component name>-<timestamp at rotation>`, where the "component
name" is the service it provides, for example `manager` or `admin-server`.

### Usage statistics and crash reports

During normal use, the Trusted Registry generates usage statistics and crash
reports. This information is collected by Docker, Inc. to help prioritize
features, fix bugs, and improve our products. Specifically, Docker, Inc.
collects the following information:

* Error logs
* Crash logs

## Emergency access to Docker Trusted Registry

If your authenticated or public access to the Trusted Registry UI has stopped
working, but your Trusted Registry admin container is still running, you can add
an
[ambassador container](https://docs.docker.com/articles/ambassador_pattern_linking/)
to get temporary unsecure access to it by running:

    $ docker run --rm -it --link docker_trusted_registry_admin_server:admin -p 9999:80 svendowideit/ambassador

> **Note:** This guide assumes that you are a member of the `docker` group, > or
have root privileges. Otherwise, you may need to add `sudo` to the previous
example command. >
>

This gives you access on port `9999` on your Trusted Registry server -
`http://<dtr-host-ip>:9999/admin/`.

### SSH Access to host

As an extra measure of safety, ensure you have SSH access to the Trusted
Registry host before you start using it.

If you are hosting Trusted Registry on an EC2 host launched from the AWS
Marketplace AMI, note that the user is `ec2-user`:
`/path/to/private_key/id_rsa ec2-user@<dtr-dns-entry>`.

## Services

The Trusted Registry runs several Docker services which are essential to its reliability and usability. The following services are included; you can see their details by
viewing the [Trusted Registry Dashboard](#dashboard) and [Logs](#logs) pages:

* `admin_server`: Used for displaying system health, performing upgrades,
configuring settings, and viewing logs.
* `load_balancer`: Used for maintaining high availability by distributing load
to each image storage service (`image_storage_X`).
* `log_aggregator`: A microservice used for aggregating logs from each of the
other services. Handles log persistence and rotation on disk.
* `image_storage_X`: Stores Docker images using the [Docker Registry HTTP API V2](http://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/). Typically,
multiple image storage services are used in order to provide greater uptime and
faster, more efficient resource utilization.
* `postgres`: A database service used to host authentication (LDAP) data and other datasets as needed by Docker Trusted Registry.

## Docker Trusted Registry system management

The `docker/trusted-registry` image is used to control the Trusted Registry
system. This image uses the Docker socket to orchestrate the multiple services
that comprise the Trusted Registry.

     $ sudo bash -c "$(sudo docker run docker/trusted-registry [COMMAND])"

Supported commands are: `install`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `pull`, `info`,
`export-settings`, `diagnostics`, `status`, `upgrade`.

> **Note**: `sudo` is needed for `docker/trusted-registry` commands to
> ensure that the Bash script is run with full access to the Docker host.

### `install`

Install Docker Trusted Registry.

### `start`

Start Docker Trusted Registry containers that are not running.

### `stop`

Stop Docker Trusted Registry containers that are running.

### `restart`

Stop and then start the Docker Trusted Registry containers.

### `status`

Display the current running status of only the Docker Trusted Registry containers.

### `diagnostics`

The `diagnostics` command is used to extract configuration and run time data
about your containers for support purposes.

The output includes the `docker inspect` output for all
containers, running and not, so check the resulting files for passwords
and other proprietary information before sending it.

`$ sudo bash -c "$(docker run docker/trusted-registry diagnostics)" > diagnostics.zip`

> **Warning:** These diagnostics files may contain secrets that you need to remove
> before passing on - such as raw container log files, Azure storage credentials, or passwords that may be
> sent to non-Docker Trusted Registry containers using the `docker run -e PASSWORD=asdf` environment variable
> options.

Stream to STDOUT a zip file containing CSDE and Docker Trusted Registry
configuration, state, and log files to help the Docker Enterprise support team:

- your Docker host's `ca-certificates.crt`
- `containers/`: the first 20 running, stopped and paused containers `docker inspect`
  information and log files.
- `dockerEngine/`: the Docker daemon's `info` and `version` output
- `dockerState/`: the Docker daemon's container states, image states, daemon log file, and daemon configuration file
- `dtrlogs/`: the Docker Trusted Registry container log files
- `manager/`: the Docker Trusted Registry `/usr/local/etc/dtr` configuration directory and manager `info` output. See the [export settings section](#export-settings) for more details.
- `sysinfo/`: Host information
- `errors.txt`: errors and warnings encountered while running diagnostics


### `export-settings`

Export the Trusted Registry configuration files for backup or diagnostics use.

`$ sudo bash -c "$(docker run docker/trusted-registry export-settings)" > export-settings.tar.gz`

> **Warning:** These diagnostics files may contain secrets that you need to remove
> before passing on - such as Azure storage credentials.

Stream to STDOUT a gzipped tar file containing the Trusted Registry
configuration files from `/usr/local/etc/dtr/`:

- `garant.yml`
- `generatedConfigs/nginx.conf`
- `generatedConfigs/stacker.yml`
- `hub.yml`
- `license.json`
- `ssl/server.pem`
- `storage.yml`

## Client Docker Daemon diagnostics

To debug client Docker daemon communication issues with the Trusted Registry,
Docker also provides a diagnostics tool to be run on the client Docker daemon.

> **Warning:** These diagnostics files may contain secrets that you need to remove
> before passing on - such as raw container log files, Azure storage credentials, or passwords that may be
> sent to non-Docker Trusted Registry containers using the `docker run -e PASSWORD=asdf` environment variable
> options.

You can download and run this tool using the following command:

> **Note:** If you supply an administrator username and password, then the
> `diagnostics` tool will also download some logs and configuration data
> from the remote Docker Trusted Registry server.

```
$ wget https://dhe.mycompany.com/admin/bin/diagnostics && chmod +x diagnostics
$ sudo ./diagnostics dhe.mycompany.com > enduserDiagnostics.zip DTR
administrator password (provide empty string if there is no admin server
authentication):
WARN  [1.1.0-alpha-001472_g8a9ddb4] Encountered errors running diagnostics
errors=[Failed to copy DTR Adminserver's exported settings into ZIP output:
"Failed to read next tar header: \"archive/tar: invalid tar header\"" Failed to

error running "dmidecode": "exit status 127"]
```

The zip file will contain the following information:

- your local Docker host's `ca-certificates.crt`
- `containers/`: the first 20 running, stopped and paused containers `docker inspect`
  information and log files.
- `dockerEngine/`: the local Docker daemon's `info` and `version` output
- `dockerState/`: the local Docker daemon's container states, image states, log file, and daemon configuration file
- `dtr/`: Remote Docker Trusted Registry services information. This directory will only be populated if the user enters a Docker Trusted Registry "admin" username and password.
- - `dtr/logs/`: the remote Docker Trusted Registry container log files. This directory will only be populated if the user enters a Docker Trusted Registry "admin" username and password.
- - `dtr/exportedSettings/`: the Docker Trusted Registry manager container's log files and a backup of the `/usr/local/etc/dtr` Docker Trusted Registry configuration directory. See the [export settings section](#export-settings) for more details.
- `sysinfo/`: local Host information
- `errors.txt`: errors and warnings encountered while running diagnostics

### Starting and stopping Docker Trusted Registry

If you need to stop and/or start the Trusted Registry (for example, upgrading, or troubleshooting), use the following commands:

`sudo bash -c "$(docker run docker/trusted-registry stop)"`
`sudo bash -c "$(docker run docker/trusted-registry start)"`
