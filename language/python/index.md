> Thanks for your interest in learning how to containerize a Python application. We are actively writing this guide. Watch this space!

Meanwhile, here's an outline of the tasks we are planning to cover. Using the Python getting started guide, you'll learn how to:

* Create a new Dockerfile which contains instructions required to build a Python image
* Build an image and run the newly built image as a container
* Set up volumes and networking
* Orchestrate containers using Compose
* Use containers for development
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your application using GitHub Actions
