When you register for  a Docker ID, your Docker ID is your user namespace
in Docker Hub and your username on the [Docker Forums](https://forums.docker.com/){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

1.  Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

2.  Click **Create Docker ID** (top right).

3.  Fill out the required fields:

    - **Docker ID** (or username): Must be 4 to 30 characters long, only numbers
      and lowercase letters.

    - **Email address**: Must be unique and valid.

    - **Password**: Must be 6 to 128 characters long.

4.  Click **Sign Up**. Docker sends a verification email to the address you
    provided.

5.  Go to your email and click the link to verify your address. You cannot log
    in until you verify.
