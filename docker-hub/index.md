[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com){: target="_blank" class="_"} is a hosted
registry service where you can create repositories and store Docker images that
you build and push, or by linking to your source code and building in Docker Hub
itself.

Docker Hub features include:

- **Discover images**: Search, explore, and pull community, official, and partner content.
- **Manage repositories**: Create repos and control access with user orgs and teams.
- **Build images**: Automatically build from source code and configure webhook triggers.
- **Publish images**: Push and publish your community, official, and partner content.

Log in to Docker Hub with [your free Docker ID](accounts){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

## Discover and pull content

Explore and pull Docker images from community and official repositories. You can
search the Docker Hub website or run `docker search` at the commandline.

For details see, [Discover and pull content](discover).

## Manage teams and organizations

Configure teams and organizations to share (and limit) access to your image
repositories.

You can create public repositories which can be accessed by all Hub users,
or you can create private repositories with limited access that you control.

For details see, [Manage repositories](manage).

## Build images automatically

Create new images automatically when you make changes to a source code
repository. Use webhooks to trigger actions after a successful push to a
repository.

For details see, [Build images automatically](build).

## Push and publish content

Push your Docker images to Docker Hub and publish from your public repositories
for the community to use. Independent software vendors (ISV) can distribute and
sell their Docker certified content by joining the Docker vendor partner
program.

For details see, [Publish content on Docker Hub](publish).
