[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com){: target="_blank" class="_"} users have
access to a content catalog that includes community images as well as
high-quality content from approved publishers. Explore trial, free, and
commercial products from Independent software vendors (ISV).

## Content types

There are four types of content in Docker Hub:

- **Community images**: Public images published by any Docker Hub user.

- **Official images**: Content curated by Docker that promotes best `Dockerfile`
  practices and is designed for common use cases.

- **Partner content**: Verified commercial products from publishers that includes
  free products, trials, and paid products.

- **Certified content**: Docker EE compatible content that is scanned and tested and
  that comes with support from the publisher and Docker.

> Features of partner and certified content
>
> - Images are versioned.
> - Images you are using will not change under the hood.
> - Updates are sent when new versions and patches come out.
> - You can easily roll back to the previous version if necessary.
