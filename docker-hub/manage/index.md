Docker Hub provides a hosted registry service where you can create repositories
to store your Docker images.

You can push images that you build locally to your repos, or you can link to
your source code and do [autobuilds](../build) within Docker Hub  itself. You
can also control access to repos by creating organizations and teams.

## Next steps

- [Create repositories](repos) to store your images
- [Push images](push-images) to your repo (or build them within Docker Hub)
- [Control access](orgs-teams) to your repositories with organizations and teams
