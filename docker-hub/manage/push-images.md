Docker Hub provides a hosted registry service where you can create repositories
to store your Docker images.

> Pushing to Docker Hub is supported in Docker Engine 1.6 and higher.

Test pulling from an official Docker Hub repository and pushing to your personal
one:

{% include docker-hub-cli-commands.md %}
