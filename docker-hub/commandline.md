The Docker CLI provides access to Docker Hub services with these commands:

- [docker login](/engine/reference/commandline/login.md)
- [docker logout](/engine/reference/commandline/logout.md)
- [docker pull](/engine/reference/commandline/pull.md)
- [docker push](/engine/reference/commandline/push.md)
- [docker search](/engine/reference/commandline/search.md)


Test the CLI commands with this command-line scenario:

{% include docker-hub-cli-commands.md %}
