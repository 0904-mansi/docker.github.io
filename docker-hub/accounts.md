**Creating an account in Docker Hub is the same as registering for a Docker ID.**
If you already have a Docker ID, you can log in to Docker Hub.

{% include register-for-docker-id.md %}

Docker Hub uses your free Docker ID as your account namespace and to save your
account settings. You can also create or join Docker Hub
[organizations and teams](manage/orgs-teams/){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

> Log in benefits

> Without a Docker ID, and without signing in, you can `search` Docker Hub and
> `pull` images. However, you must log in to `push` images, leave comments, or
> to star ![starm](images/star.png){: .inline} a repository.

## Password reset process

If you forget your password, or can't access your account for some reason, you
can reset your password from the Settings page.

## Email addresses

You can associate multiple email addresses with your Docker ID, and one of these
becomes the primary address for the account. The primary address is used by
Docker to send password reset notifications and other important information, so
be sure to keep it updated.

To add another email address to your Docker ID:

1.  In Docker Hub, click **Settings** under your username.

2.  Enter an email address in the "New Email" field.

3. Click **Add Email** to send a verification email.

4. Click the link in the email to verify your address.

The new email address is not added to the account until you confirm it by
clicking the link in the verification email. This link is only good for a
limited time. To send a new verification email, click the envelope icon next to
the email address that you want to verify.

If you have multiple verified email addresses associated with the account, you
can click **Set as primary** to change the primary email address.

## Upgrade your account

Free Docker Hub accounts include one private registry. If you need more private
registries, you can [upgrade your account](https://hub.docker.com/account/billing-plans/){: target="_blank" class="_"}
to a paid plan directly from the Hub.
