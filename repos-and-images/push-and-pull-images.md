## Push and pull overview

One of your main activities you do in the Trusted Registry, is to push and pull
images to and from the Trusted Registry image storage service. For example, you
might pull an official image for Ubuntu from the Docker Hub, customize it with
configuration settings for your infrastructure, and then push it to your Docker
Trusted Registry image storage for other developers to pull and use for their
development environments.

Pushing and pulling images with Trusted Registry works similarly like any other
Docker registry. You use the `docker pull` command to retrieve images and the
`docker push` command to add an image.

> **Note**: If your Docker Trusted Registry instance has authentication enabled, you will need to
>use your command line to `docker login <dtr-hostname>` (for example `docker login
> dtr.yourdomain.com`).
>
> Failures due to unauthenticated `docker push` and `docker pull` commands
> look like:
>
>     $ docker pull dtr.yourdomain.com/hello-world
>     Pulling repository dtr.yourdomain.com/hello-world
>     FATA[0001] Error: image hello-world:latest not found
>
>     $ docker push dtr.yourdomain.com/hello-world
>     The push refers to a repository [dtr.yourdomain.com/hello-world] (len: 1)
>     e45a5af57b00: Image push failed
>     FATA[0001] Error pushing to registry: token auth attempt for registry
>     https://dtr.yourdomain.com/v2/:
>     https://dtr.yourdomain.com/auth/v2/token/?scope=
>     repository%3Ahello-world%3Apull%2Cpush&service=dtr.yourdomain.com
>     request failed with status: 401 Unauthorized

## Push images

You push an image up to a Docker Trusted Registry repository by using the
[`docker push` command](/engine/reference/commandline/push.md).

You can add a `tag` to your image so that you can more easily identify it
among other variants and so that it refers to your Docker Trusted Registry server.

    $ docker tag hello-world:latest dtr.yourdomain.com/yourusername/hello-mine:latest

The command labels a `hello-world:latest` image using a new tag in the
`[REGISTRYHOST/][USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG]` format.  The `REGISTRYHOST` in this
case is your Docker Trusted Registry server, `dtr.yourdomain.com`, and the `USERNAME` is
`yourusername`. Lastly, the image tag is set to `hello-mine:latest`.

Once an image is tagged, you can push it to Docker Trusted Registry with:

    $ docker push dtr.yourdomain.com/yourusername/hello-mine:latest

> **Note**: If the Docker daemon on which you are running `docker push` doesn't
> have the right certificates set up, you get an error similar to:
>
>     $ docker push dtr.yourdomain.com/demouser/hello-world
>     FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: v1 ping attempt failed with error:
>     Get https://dtr.yourdomain.com/v1/_ping: x509: certificate signed by
>     unknown authority. If this private registry supports only HTTP or HTTPS
>     with an unknown CA certificate, please add `--insecure-registry
>     dtr.yourdomain.com` to the daemon's arguments. In the case of HTTPS, if
>     you have access to the registry's CA certificate, no need for the flag;
>     simply place the CA certificate at
>     /etc/docker/certs.d/dtr.yourdomain.com/ca.crt

## Pull images

You can retrieve an image with the
[`docker pull` command](/engine/reference/commandline/run.md),
or you can retrieve an image and run Docker to build the container with the
[`docker run`command](/engine/reference/commandline/run.md).

To retrieve an image from the Trusted Registry and then run Docker to build the
container, add
the needed info to `docker run`:

```bash
$ docker run dtr.yourdomain.com/yourusername/hello-mine

latest: Pulling from dtr.yourdomain.com/yourusername/hello-mine
511136ea3c5a: Pull complete
31cbccb51277: Pull complete
e45a5af57b00: Already exists
Digest: sha256:45f0de377f861694517a1440c74aa32eecc3295ea803261d62f950b1b757bed1
Status: Downloaded newer image for dtr.yourdomain.com/demouser/hello-mine:latest
```

If you don't specify a version, by default the `latest` version of an
image is pulled.

If you run `docker images` after this, then you see a `hello-mine` image.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                  TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED       VIRTUAL SIZE
dtr.yourdomain.com/yourusername/hello-mine  latest  e45a5af57b00  3 months ago  910 B
```


To pull an image without building the container, use `docker pull` and specify
your Docker Trusted Registry by adding it to the command:

```bash
$ docker pull dtr.yourdomain.com/yourusername/hello-mine
```
