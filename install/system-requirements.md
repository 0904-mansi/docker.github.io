# DTR system requirements

Docker Trusted Registry can be installed on-premises or on the cloud.
Before installing, be sure your infrastructure has these requirements.

## Software requirements

To install DTR on a node, that node node must be part of a Docker Universal
Control Plane 1.1 cluster.

<!-- TODO check these
* x.x GB of RAM
* x.x GB of available disk space
-->


## Ports used

When installing DTR on a node, make sure the following ports are open on that
node:

| Direction | Port | Purpose                                                                          |
|:---------:|:-----|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    in     | 80   | Web app and API client access to DTR.                                            |
|    in     | 443  | Web app and API client access to DTR.                                            |
|    out    | 443  | Check if new versions are available, and send anonymous usage reports to Docker. |

DTR collects anonymous usage metrics, to help us improve it. These metrics
are entirely anonymous, donâ€™t identify your company, users, applications,
or any other sensitive information. You can disable this on the DTR settings
page.
