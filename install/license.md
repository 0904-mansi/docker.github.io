# License DTR

After installing Docker Trusted Registry, you need to license your installation.
If you just want to try DTR, you can
[get a trial license](https://www.docker.com/pricing).


## Download your license

When your license is issued, you can download it on Docker Hub. On Docker Hub,
navigate to your profile settings. Then click the
[Licenses tab](https://hub.docker.com/account/licenses/).

## License your installation

Once you've downloaded the license file, you can apply it to your DTR
installation. On your browser, navigate to DTR, and then go to the **settings
page**.

<!-- TODO: add screenshot -->

**Upload the new license**, and click **save** for the changes to take effect.
