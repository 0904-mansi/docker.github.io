# Configure Docker Trusted Registry

To start, navigate to the Trusted Registry user interface (UI) > Settings, to
view configuration options. Configuring is grouped by the following:

* General Settings (for example, ports and proxies)
* Security settings
* Storage settings
* License
* Authentication settings
* Garbage collection
* Updates
* Docker daemon (this is set from the Trusted Registry CLI and not the UI)

See the [configuration overview](configuration.md) to get started.
