This feature displays image vulnerability data from DTR in the UCP web UI. If an image has a vulnerability detected by DTR's image scanning feature, we will show the number of known vulnerabilities in the UCP web UI everywhere that image is shown (e.g. the image list page, on the service details page for any Swarm services that use that image, etc.).

Limitations

* This feature will only work with DTRs that have UCP single sign-on enabled.
* We do not show vulnerabilities on Kubernetes deployments or daemonsets: they only appear for containers, Swarm services, pods, and images.

Requirements

* You must have an advanced license to use this feature.
* DTR must be version 2.6.0 or higher.

To access vulnerability data on UCP, run the following steps:

1. Deploy UCP
2. Deploy DTR on the same UCP cluster
3. (Enable single-sign on DTR)[/datacenter/dtr/2.4/guides/admin/configure/enable-single-sign-on.md]
3. Upload an advanced license in UCP
4. Push some images to DTR and scan them
5. The UCP web UI will display image vulnerabilities
