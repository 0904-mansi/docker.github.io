This feature displays image vulnerability data from DTR in the UCP web UI. If an image has a vulnerability detected by DTR's image scanning feature, we will show the number of known vulnerabilities in the UCP web UI everywhere that image is shown (e.g. the image list page, on the service details page for any Swarm services that use that image, etc.).


Step-by-Step Process

1. Deploy UCP
2. Deploy DTR on that UCP cluster. Make sure that you enable single-sign on DTR (you can do this at install time by providing a --dtr-external-url flag to the DTR install command, or you can enable it in the DTR admin settings page after installation).
3. Upload an advanced license in UCP.
4. Push some images to DTR and scan them.
5. Observe their vulnerabilities in the UCP web UI.

Limitations

* This feature will only work with DTRs that have UCP single sign-on enabled.
* We do not show vulnerabilities on Kubernetes deployments or daemonsets: they only appear for containers, Swarm services, pods, and images.

Requirements

* You must have an advanced license to use this feature.
* DTR must be version 2.6.0 or higher.
