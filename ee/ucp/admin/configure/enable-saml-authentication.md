Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication data between an identity provider and a service provider. SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) gives you access to UCP through an identity provider of your choice. For more information about SAML, see the [SAML XML website] (http://saml.xml.org/)

A list of the identity providers that we support is found in the [Docker Compatibility matrix] (http://success.docker.com/article/compatibility-matrix).

## Prererquisites

Before you can enable SAMLauthentication, you must first be set up with your identity provider of choice.
