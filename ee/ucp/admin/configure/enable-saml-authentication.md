Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication data between an identity provider and a service provider. SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) gives you access to UCP through an identity provider of your choice. ZFor more informsation about SAML, see the [SAML XML website] (http://saml.xml.org/)

A list of the identity providers that we support is found in the Docker Compatibility matrix.
