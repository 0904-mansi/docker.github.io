<p>You can configure UCP to allow users to deploy and run services only in
worker nodes. This ensures all cluster management functionality stays
performant, and makes the cluster more secure.</p>

<p>If a user deploys a malicious service that can affect the node where it
is running, it wonâ€™t be able to affect other nodes in the cluster, or
any cluster management functionality.</p>

<p>To restrict users from deploying to manager nodes, log in with administrator
credentials to the UCP web UI, navigate to the <strong>Admin Settings</strong>
page, and choose <strong>Scheduler</strong>.</p>

<p>You can then choose if user services should be allowed to run on manager nodes
or not.</p>

<p>Having a grant with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Scheduler</code> role against the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> collection takes
precedence over any other grants with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Node Schedule</code> on subcollections.</p>
