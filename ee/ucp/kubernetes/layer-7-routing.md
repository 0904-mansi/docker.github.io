When you deploy a Kubernetes application, you may want to make it accessible
to users using hostnames instead of IP addresses.

Kubernetes provides **ingress controllers** for this. This functionality is
specific to Kubernetes. If you're trying to route traffic to Swarm-based
applications, check [layer 7 routing with Swarm](../interlock/index.md).

Use an ingress controller when you want to:

* Give your Kubernetes app an externally-reachable URL.
* Load-balance traffic to your app.

## Deploy NGINX ingress controller

A popular ingress controller within the Kubernetes Community is the [NGINX controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx), and can be used in Docker Enterprise Edition, but it is not directly supported by Docker, Inc.

Learn about [ingress in Kubernetes](https://v1-11.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). 

For an example of a YAML NGINX kube ingress deployment, refer to <https://success.docker.com/article/how-to-configure-a-default-tls-certificate-for-the-kubernetes-nginx-ingress-controller>.
Note that this example uses hostPorts for controller ports. This exposes the host port ( selected in a high range using `hostPort: 38080`) directly into the nodes. 
Port 38080 is used for HTTP and port 38443 is used for HTTPS. Make sure that your loadbalancer forwards to the applicable ports on the nodes. You can change them as needed.

Deploy your controller using `kubectl` and verify pods are deployed successfully:

```
üê≥  ‚Üí kubectl apply -f nginx-ingress-deployment.yaml
deployment.extensions "default-http-backend" created
service "default-http-backend" created
configmap "nginx-configuration" created
configmap "tcp-services" created
configmap "udp-services" created
deployment.extensions "nginx-ingress-controller" created

 üê≥  ‚Üí kubectl get pod -n infra -o wide
