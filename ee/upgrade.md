To upgrade Docker Enterprise Edition you need to individually upgrade each of the
following components:

1. Docker Engine.
2. Universal Control Plane (UCP).
3. Docker Trusted Registry (DTR).

While upgrading, some of these components become temporarily unavailable.
So you should schedule your upgrades to take place outside business peak hours
to make sure there's no impact to your business.

## Create a backup

Before upgrading Docker EE, you should make sure you [create a backup](backup.md).
This makes it possible to recover if anything goes wrong during the upgrade.

## Check the compatibility matrix

You should also check the [compatibility matrix](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Compatibility_Matrix),
to make sure all Docker EE components are certified to work with one another.
You may also want to check the
[Docker EE maintenance lifecycle](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Maintenance_Lifecycle),
to understand until when your version may be supported.

## Apply firewall rules

Before you upgrade, make sure:

- Your firewall rules are configured to allow traffic in the ports UCP uses
  for communication. Learn about [UCP port requirements](ucp/admin/install/system-requirements.md#ports-used).
- Make sure you don't have containers or services that are listening on ports
  used by UCP.
- Configure your load balancer to forward TCP traffic to the Kubernetes API
  server port (6443/TCP by default) running on manager nodes.

> Certificates
>
> Externally signed certificates are used by the Kubernetes API server and
> the UCP controller.

## Upgrade Docker Engine

To avoid application downtime, you should be running Docker in Swarm mode and
deploying your workloads as Docker services. That way you can
drain the nodes of any workloads before starting the upgrade.

If you have workloads running as containers as opposed to swarm services,
make sure they are configured with a [restart policy](/engine/admin/start-containers-automatically/).
This ensures that your containers are started automatically after the upgrade.

To ensure that workloads running as Swarm services have no downtime, you need to:

1. Determine if the network is in danger of exaustion
   a. Triage and fix an upgrade that exhausted IP address space, or
   b. Upgrade a service network live to add IP addresses
3. Drain the node you want to upgrade so that services get scheduled in another node.
4. Upgrade the Docker Engine on that node.
5. Make the node available again.

If you do this sequentially for every node, you can upgrade with no
application downtime.
When upgrading manager nodes, make sure the upgrade of a node finishes before
you start upgrading the next node. Upgrading multiple manager nodes at the same
time can lead to a loss of quorum, and possible data loss.

### Determine if the network is in danger of exaustion

Starting with a cluser with one or more services configured, determine whether some networks 
may require update in order to function correctly after an 18.09 upgrade.

1. SSH into a manager node.

2. Fetch and deploy a service that would exhaust IP addresses in one of its overlay networks, such as (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctelfer/moby-lb-upgrade-test/master/low_addrs/docker-compose.yml)


3. Run the following:

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ctelfer/ip-util-check
```

If the network is in danger of exhaustion, the output will show similar warnings or errors:

```
 Overlay IP Utilization Report
    ----
    Network ex_net1/XXXXXXXXXXXX has an IP address capacity of 29 and uses 28 addresses
            ERROR: network will be over capacity if upgrading Docker engine version 18.06
                   or later.
    ----
    Network ex_net2/YYYYYYYYYYYY has an IP address capacity of 29 and uses 24 addresses
            WARNING: network could exhaust IP addresses if the cluster scales to 5 or more nodes
    ----
    Network ex_net3/ZZZZZZZZZZZZ has an IP address capacity of 61 and uses 52 addresses
            WARNING: network could exhaust IP addresses if the cluster scales to 9 or more nodes
```

####  Triage and fix an upgrade that exhausted IP address space

Starting with a cluser with services that exhaust their overlay address space in 18.09, adjust the deployment to fix this issue.

1. SSH into a manager node.

2. Fetch and deploy a service that exhausts IP addresses in one of its overlay networks such as (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctelfer/moby-lb-upgrade-test/master/exhaust_addrs_3_nodes/docker-compose.yml).

3. Check the `docker service ls` output. It will diplay the service that is  unable to completely fill all its replicas such as: 

```
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS   IMAGE               PORTS
wn3x4lu9cnln        ex_service          replicated          19/24      nginx:latest
```

4. Use `docker service ps ex_service` to find a failed replica such as:

```
ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE              ERROR               PORTS
    ... 
i64lee19ia6s         \_ ex_service.11   nginx:latest        tk1706-ubuntu-1     Shutdown            Rejected 7 minutes ago     "node is missing network attacâ€¦"
    ... 
```

5. Examine the error using `docker inspect`. In this example, the  `docker inspect i64lee19ia6s` output shows the error in the `Status.Err` field:

```
... 
            "Status": {
                "Timestamp": "2018-08-24T21:03:37.885405884Z",
                "State": "rejected",
                "Message": "preparing",
                **"Err": "node is missing network attachments, ip addresses may be exhausted",**
                "ContainerStatus": {
                    "ContainerID": "",
                    "PID": 0,
                    "ExitCode": 0
                },
                "PortStatus": {}
            },
    ...
```

6. Adjust the `- subnet:` field in `docker-compose.yml` to have a larger subnet such as `- subnet: 10.1.1.0/22`.  

7. Remove the original service and re-deploy with the new compose file. Confirm the adjusted service deployed successfully.

#### Upgrade a service network live to add IP addresses

Identify a subnet with few remaining IP addresses in a live service and upgrade the network live to add IP addresses.


1. SSH into a manager node.

2. Fetch and deploy a service that has very few IP addresses available in one of its overlay networks.

3. Run the following to determine if the subnet is near capactity:

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ctelfer/ip-util-check 
```

4. Run the following to create a new subnet for the services on the overloaded subnet XXX. Substitute the overloaded network name for XXX.

```
$ docker network create -d overlay --subnet=10.252.0.0/8 XXX_bump_addrs 
```

5. Run the following for each service to add the new network to the service.

```
$ docker service update --detach=false --network-add XXX_bump_addrs ex_serviceY 
```

7. Run the following for each service attached to XXX to remove the overloaded network from the service.

```
$ docker service update --detach=false --network-rm XXX ex_serviceY 
```

8. Run the following to remove the now unused network.

```
$ docker network rm XXX 
```

9. Repeat the process of adding a new network with fresh address space but name it the same as the original overloaded subnet. 
Then remove the "XXX_bump_addrs" subnet from each service. This leaves all services attached to a network named XXX, but with an 
increased pool of addresses.
    

10. Run the following to confirm that subnet allocations are satisfactory. 

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ctelfer/ip-util-check 
```

### Perform a hit-less upgrade

To upgrade an entire Docker environment, use the following steps.


1. SSH into the manager node.


2.Promote two other nodes to manager: 

```
$ docker node promote manager1 
$ docker node promote manager2
```
    
3. Start a stack with clients connecting to services. For example:

```
$ curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctelfer/moby-lb-upgrade-test/master/upgrade_test_ct/docker-compose.yml" > docker-compose.yml
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml test
```

4. Upgrade all subsequent managers:

   a. SSH into each manager.

   b. Drain containers from the node: 

      ```
      $ docker node update --availability drain $(docker node ls | grep managerY | awk '{print $1}')
      ```

   c. Verify containers have been moved off: 
      
      ```
      $ docker container ls
      ```
 
   d. Upgrade docker to 18.09 on the system.

5. After upgrading all the managers, reactivate all the nodes:
   
   a. SSH into each manager.
   
   b. Run the following to update all the nodes:

    ```
    $ for m in "manager0 manager1 manager2" ; do \
        docker node update --availability active $(docker node ls | grep $m | awk '{print $1}') \
    done
    ```

6. Repeat the steps above for each worker but with two differences:
   a. You muset drain and activeate the workers from a manager.
   b. It is possible to reactivate each worker as soon as the upgrade for that worker is done.


### Drain the node

Start by draining the node so that services get scheduled in another node and
continue running without downtime.
For that, run this command on a manager node:

```
docker node update --availability drain <node>
```

### Perform the upgrade

To upgrade a node individually by operating system, please follow the instructions
listed below:

* [Windows Server](/install/windows/docker-ee.md#update-docker-ee)
* [Ubuntu](/install/linux/docker-ee/ubuntu.md#upgrade-docker-ee)
* [RHEL](/install/linux/docker-ee/rhel.md#upgrade-docker-ee)
* [CentOS](/install/linux/docker-ee/centos.md#upgrade-docker-ee)
* [Oracle Linux](/install/linux/docker-ee/oracle.md#upgrade-docker-ee)
* [SLES](/install/linux/docker-ee/suse.md#upgrade-docker-ee)

### Make the node active

Once you finish upgrading the node, make it available to run workloads. For
this, run:

```
docker node update --availability active <node>
```

## Upgrade UCP

Once you've upgraded the Docker Engine running on all the nodes, upgrade UCP.
You can do this from the UCP web UI.

![UCP update notification banner](images/upgrade-1.png){: .with-border}

Click on the banner, and choose the version you want to upgrade to.

![UCP upgrade page - version selection](images/upgrade-2.png){: .with-border}

Once you click **Upgrade UCP**, the upgrade starts. If you want you can upgrade
UCP from the CLI instead. [Learn more](/ee/ucp/admin/install/upgrade.md).

## Upgrade DTR

Log in into the DTR web UI to check if there's a new version available.

![DTR settings page](images/upgrade-3.png){: .with-border}

Then follow these [instructions to upgrade DTR](/ee/dtr/admin/upgrade.md).
When this is finished, your Docker EE has been upgraded.
