# Licensing

To run Docker Trusted Registry, you need a Docker license, obtained either by
purchasing Docker Trusted Registry, acquiring a trial license, or through an AWS
hourly subscription. If you a purchase a license or you have a trial license, it is associated with your free Docker Hub account or Docker Hub organization. 

## Get your Trusted Registry License

1. Go to the [Docker Subscription page](https://hub.docker.com/enterprise/) and select an edition. After completing a brief registration process, follow the steps to acquire it.

      **Note**: You may need to disable any pop-up blocker installed on your browser in order to complete the download.

2. After acquiring your license, view or download it by logging in to
Docker Hub, going to your account settings (gear icon at upper right), and
selecting ["Licenses"](https://hub.docker.com/account/licenses/) from the
top nav bar. Download the license by clicking the cloud icon.

The Licenses page displays your currently available licenses and if you selected the trial license, it also keeps track of how many trial days are remaining.

When installing Docker Trusted Registry, you must first obtain your license, then apply it.

**Note** The Licenses page is where you download the CS engine script by selecting the operating system it needs to run on.
