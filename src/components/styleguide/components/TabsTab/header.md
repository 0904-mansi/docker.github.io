### Tabs and Tab

Unopinionated stateless Tabs.

`<Tab>` extends `<Button>` and can be used outside of the `<Tabs>` wrapper component which can be thought of as a "Controller".

When using `<Tab>` standalone any number of tabs can be selected simultaneously although they will not be aware of each other.
